# Extreme-Minesweeper
APCS block d final project
Everything updated is in the master-repo branch now

I've added a testing timer to the "Rendered-Timer" branch, under the "ProgressBar" folder. It's easier to use eclipse to run the code since you can just import everything. The "res" foloder is needed for rendering the actual characters and numbers.
